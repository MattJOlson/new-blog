title: Book review - Camille Fournier's "The Manager's Path"
---

I thought I'd start writing book reviews, because there are a _lot_ of
books that've helped me immensely but also don't seem to be well-known.
In this case, I picked up Camille Fournier's _The Manager's Path_
shortly after falling into my first team-lead role, and quickly realized
I should've read it far earlier.

## Who should read this book?
Pretty much everyone in the tech industry.

# Even me? I'm a junior developer, and I don't ever want to be a manager
Even you.

## Who _shouldn't_ read this book?
My lovely parents, who are retired and might read this blog every once
in a while to see what I'm up to.

## What am I going to get out of it?
_The Manager's Path_ follows a rough "software dev to CTO" career
progression, with a few spurs off to the side for finger-quotes "tech
roles" that aren't explicitly tasked with people management (tech lead,
staff engineer, lead architect, that sort of thing). There's a chapter
at the end on bootstrapping, or changing, engineering culture.

The key value this brings to those of us near the bottom of the org
chart is _setting basic expectations._ Fournier _starts_ with a chapter
for individual contributors (ICs), which is all about pointing out
things your manager should be doing, and why. It takes some of the
mystery out of the relationship -- which, as she points out, can be
jarring.

For example, if you know about 1-on-1s, that recurring meeting your
team lead schedules on your second or third week with the company turns
into a good sign rather than a worrying unknown. If you've been with the
team for a while and you _don't_ have a 1-on-1 scheduled, this is your
opportunity to manage up -- ask your lead for a quick meeting over
coffee to get some feedback.

The whole book's valuable for this kind of context. Maybe you never want
to be a CTO, but knowing more about their responsibilities can give you
some context on what _your_ CTO just did. 

## But isn't the book about _management?_
Oh. Yeah. If and when you _do_ end up in a leadership position -- which
can be as seemingly innocuous as "hey, can you mentor our new hire while
they're onboarding?" or as terrifying as "hey, your team lead's moving
to a different company and you're the best replacement we have" -- this
is a great book for actually _learning how to lead._ I'm sure there are
companies out there with comprehensive internal leadership training, but
if you aren't working for one of those, this book is a great
alternative.

While the book's densely packed with knowledge, I found it a pretty
quick and engaging read. There's enough shift back and forth between
general principles, personal anecdotes, hypotheticals, and sidebars that
it never really bogs down. Pretty much by construction, most of the book
is going to be _interesting context_ rather than _directly relevant,_
which encourages skimming and revisiting rather than a close, cover to
cover study. You can probably get, I dunno, 80% of the benefit out of
_The Manager's Path_ over a weekend, then come back later for more
focused study of individual bits as and if they get relevant.

# But I said I didn't _want_ to go into management!
Weird, I've said that too.

Seriously though, this book is helpful even if you want to stay 100% on
the tech path. There's not a _lot_ of direct treatment of senior
tech-track roles, but Fournier often contrasts senior ICs with managers
at roughly the same level of responsibility. If nothing else, you'll be
able to see the sorts of decisions you'd be leaving for someone in a
more manager-ish role (maybe you're actually more interested in driving
those!), and how what you like to think of as a technical job title
really involves a lot of leadership and consensus-building. (Imagine how
effective an enterprise architect who rules by decrees handed down from
a castle in the clouds is going to be. Or maybe you don't have to.)

## Summary
This book will give you context for what your manager, and the rest of
your company's management structure, are trying to get done, with a bit
of why and how they're doing it. That alone is worth the price of
admission, but beyond that, it's a fantastic resource if you ever find
yourself having to mentor, manage, or lead people in tech. It might even
make you _choose_ that path, or at least consider it.

Buy it and read it.
