title: "Recipe: Cheesy quinoa \"grits\""
---

Serves four as a side.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 1 shallot, fine dice
- 4 cloves garlic, fine dice
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp salt (4g)
- 1/4 tsp MSG
- "some" chili flakes
- 2 Bay leaves
- 1 cup Gruyère, shredded
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 cups chicken stock

## Method

1. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.
2. Add the garlic and chili flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant and
   barely starting to turn golden, about 2-3min
3. Add quinoa and increase heat to medium. Toast quinoa another 2-3min,
   stirring occasionally. There's no visual cue for this, just don't go
   too long.
4. Add milk, stock, salt, and spices. Cover and bring to a boil, then
   immediately reduce to a bare simmer (low heat). Cook covered for 15min.
5. After 15min, uncover and cook uncovered until most of the liquid has
   disappeared, about another 5min. Remove Bay leaves, fold in cheese, then
   taste for salt. Continue to cook, stirring, until it hits your desired
   consistency.

## Discussion

Look, I have "grits" in scare-quotes for a reason. These obviously aren't
_grits_. They may, however, serve a similar purpose for you, and they taste
goddamn great.

This is an adaptation of my [everyday quinoa](/posts/2021-08-02-recipe-everyday-quinoa.html)
recipe / technique to make it softer and richer. That recipe uses a 2:1 ratio
of liquid to quinoa, and uses plain water. This one uses a 3:1 ratio, with
chicken stock and milk for the cooking liquid. (If you happen to have some
shrimp shells around to make stock from, possibly because you're gonna serve
the shrimp on these "grits", it'd do magnificently with that instead of the
chicken stock.) Most of the discussion points from that recipe still apply to
this one, so give it a read.

You don't have to be too cautious about adding the liquid, but keep an eye on
it as it comes to a boil so you don't overflow your saucepan and drop milk on
your burner.

I like Gruyère in this, since it melts nicely and doesn't have _too_ strong or
distinctive a flavour. You could put cheddar in this and it'd be good too, or
more or less anything else you'd expect to melt in nicely. You're not trying to
_flavour_ the quinoa with the cheese, you're improving the texture and adding
richness.

(I mean, if you _want to_ flavour the quinoa with the cheese, go ahead, that's
you cooking.)

If you're kind of offended that I've called this "grits", even with the scare
quotes, check back later when I annoy the Italians with quinoa "risotto". But
I hope you make some of this anyway, it's really good.
