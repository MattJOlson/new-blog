    <title>Test data semiotics: pull it "out of band"</title>
    <link>https://blog.audax-labs.com/posts/2021-08-09-Test-data-out-of-band.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the nice things about the standard sum types is that they can give you a lot of explicitness. In a <code>Maybe String</code>, <code>Nothing</code> is pretty unambiguous; there ain’t no string there. By comparison, <code>Just ""</code> is also unambiguous; it’s an empty string, not (for example) the default value a JSON parser spat out to populate a missing field. The <code>Maybe</code> part is in a sense out of band of the <code>String</code> part, and that makes it easier to reason about it separately.</p> <p>By contrast, in a language without sum types you’re often forced to carve off part of]]></description>

    <title>Previewing a post in Hakyll</title>
    <link>https://blog.audax-labs.com/posts/2021-08-07-previewing-a-post.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I still don’t have a great idea of what I want to do, aesthetically, with this blog. That’s not so bad, it gives me room to mess around and try things, and one of the things I wanted to try is a fairly compact front page with a preview of the latest post, a few links to recent posts, and pointers into the archives. I implemented the first this afternoon, and I thought I’d write about it.</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, I’m aware that Hakyll supports <code>teaser</code> text with <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code> comments. Where’s the fun in that?</p> </blockquote> <p>My first stop]]></description>

    <title>Standing up a Hakyll blog with Windows and Netlify</title>
    <link>https://blog.audax-labs.com/posts/2021-08-01-New-blog-who-dis.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my second attempt at a static-site-gen blog. So far it’s going a lot better than the first, because I’m working with some technologies I really like, but that’s not to say everything was smooth sailing. <em>That</em> means a story, which means this blog post.</p> <p>I got up yesterday morning and decided to start messing around with Haskell on my personal desktop (I write Haskell for work, too, and this felt like a decent chance to get better at it.) The first project that popped into my mind was resurrecting my blog. I’ve been meaning to try Hakyll for]]></description>

    <title>Book review - Camille Fournier's "The Manager's Path"</title>
    <link>https://blog.audax-labs.com/posts/2017-12-23-Review-The-Managers-Path.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I thought I’d start writing book reviews, because there are a <em>lot</em> of books that’ve helped me immensely but also don’t seem to be well-known. In this case, I picked up Camille Fournier’s <em>The Manager’s Path</em> shortly after falling into my first team-lead role, and quickly realized I should’ve read it far earlier.</p> <h2 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who should read this book?</h2> <p>Pretty much everyone in the tech industry.</p> <h3 id="even-me-im-a-junior-developer-and-i-dont-ever-want-to-be-a-manager">Even me? I’m a junior developer, and I don’t ever want to be a manager</h3> <p>Even you.</p> <h2 id="who-shouldnt-read-this-book">Who <em>shouldn’t</em> read this book?</h2> <p>My lovely parents, who are retired and might read this]]></description>

    <title>Flexible Code</title>
    <link>https://blog.audax-labs.com/posts/2017-02-23-Flexible-code.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="section">1.</h1> <p>Last week, another team lead asked me to take on one of his team’s products. It’s not an unreasonable request; his team’s overworked and oddly understaffed, and this particular product is closer to my team’s domain than to his. Given some of the work we’ll be doing in the future, having that product in our domain could be quite convenient.</p> <p>What’s interesting is how he sold it.</p> <p>“This shouldn’t impose much work on you guys, if any. The service has been running in production for years, now, and hasn’t changed in a while. It hasn’t crashed, hasn’t broken]]></description>
