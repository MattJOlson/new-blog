If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on twitter as
[`@arachnocapital2`](https://twitter.com/arachnocapital2).

If you'd like to get in touch more professionally, I'm on 
[Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/mjolson) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjolson/).

If you'd like to look at my personal code for some reason, I'm on
[github](https://github.com/MattJOlson). It's not very interesting, but I got
a lot of mileage out of other people's Hakyll projects so maybe something I've
written will help you.

If you'd like to email me, DM me politely on one of the above platforms and
we'll see what happens. ‚ù§
