title: About
---

My name's Matt Olson. I'm a software developer currently living just outside
Vancouver (BC, not WA) and writing back-end Haskell for [Mercury](https://mercury.com/).
Previously I've been an SRE lead(-ish), senior manager, team-level manager,
back-end and desktop developer, graduate student, teaching assistant, and
something not unlike a junior sysadmin.

This blog is where I put stuff that I want to write up for the internet, but
don't want to turn into a twitter thread. It's probably going to be mostly
tech-related, but expect some cooking content and maybe some TTRPG and digital
art stuff too. If you feel strongly that I should stick to tech, by all means
yell at me on twitter so I can ignore you in front of an audience.

I'm building this blog with [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), hosting on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
(free tier for now) running off of [GitHub](https://github.com).
