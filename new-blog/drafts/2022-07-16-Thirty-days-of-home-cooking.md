title: "Thirty days of home cooking"
---

I recently did a "thirty days of cooking all your meals" challenge with a
couple of mutuals on Twitter. [I made a thread about it](https://twitter.com/arachnocapital2/status/1537253259718430720)
with pics of what I ate, you can check it out.

I learned a few things from it, which I figured I'd write about.

# Some context

I live alone, I work from home, I don't have any particular food allergies
or aversions, and I'm a pretty decent cook. I'm not sure that makes this an
ezmode challenge, but I'm definitely not playing on Dark Souls difficulty.

Also, I didn't do this as a health thing. Cutting out restaurant food might
help some people eat more veggies or whatever; on the flip side, setting a
target like this around food might be awful for someone with a history of
disordered eating. I don't mean to present this as health advice, like for
example the Whole30 elimination diet.

# Quick and easy?

When I order takeout, it's usually because I'm pressed for time and don't
think I have time to cook (most of the rest of the time, it's because I'm
hungover and craving). So I figured I'd probably come up with some quick and
low-effort recipes to fill that role.

I kind of did, but the "quick and low-effort" cooking hack here is leftover
pasta sauce. On an induction burner set to high, it takes maybe four minutes
to cook spaghetti or fusilli to almost al dente, which is just enough time
to heat up a portion of sauce in a saucier. Toss them together, simmer them
until the pasta cooks through, grate in some parm... dinner. Or lunch. I had
pasta in red sauce nine times over 56 meals.
